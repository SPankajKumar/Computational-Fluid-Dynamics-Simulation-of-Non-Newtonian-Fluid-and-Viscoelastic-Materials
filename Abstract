The simulation of blood flow in aneurysmal arteries, particularly under non-Newtonian and
pulsatile conditions, is of considerable importance in biomedical engineering. This project
explores a computational framework using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate
such flows through an idealized aneurysm geometry, both pre- and post-stenting. Blood
is modeled as a shear-thinning fluid via the power-law formulation, with pulsatile inflow
captured using a Crank–Nicolson time integration scheme. The simulation compares two
common stent designs — coil embolization and flow-diverting stents — for their impact on
hemodynamic parameters.
